# Fruit-Spoilage-Detector
The purpose of the work mainly
focused on reducing wastage
The working of the proposed system is that different sensors are used to test fruit quality like,
a temperature sensor is used to sense a food temperature level, a pH sensor is used to test the salt content
of food. A normal pH value is stored in IOT server and compared to that food. The Gas sensor
is used to check the gas level of food it will alert normal -or abnormal conditions. The fruit
freshness is nested using a moisture sensor that measures the water content of food and testing.
